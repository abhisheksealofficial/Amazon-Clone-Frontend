# Amazon-Clone-Frontend
This is a simple clone of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. The project is centered on replicating Amazon's website layout, which includes its navigation bar, product categories, hero section, and footer. The design is an attempt to replicate Amazon's UI to help practice web development skills such as layout creation, responsive design, and user interaction effects.
